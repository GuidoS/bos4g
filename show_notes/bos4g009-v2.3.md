# BOS4G 009 v2.3.0 - 91 days left -

Welcome to the BOS4G show, it's May 15th, 2017 and there are now 91 days until FOSS4G Boston 2017.

BOS4G is a show about Boston, Open Source, and Geospatial Technology.

Hi, I'm Guido your host. I will give you updates about organizing the FOSS4G Boston 2017 as a LOC member and Co-Chair. I will also share interviews and information about other events.

## Todays topics

-   Early Bird Is Closing

Early Bird registration is a big deal for the LOC. This is the first time we will have a good sense of how many people will actually attend. Based on our experience with the abstract submissions and workshop submissions we are sure that that registration will explode in the last 24 hours.

-   JSGeo is sold out

JSGeo is a co-located conference that focuses on javascript development and it has sold out. There are a few more tickets coming up, please check their website at [jsgeo.com](http://jsgeo.com). I want to thank the JSGeo team for their support for FOSS4G. I am super thrilled to have their event tied to ours this summer.

-   opensource.com

We had a piece publishd by our operations coordinator, Ashley. It's so great to have our event and community highlighted in a more general open source community blog. I really hope that we can bring more people into our community and viceversa from the broader OSS community.

-   Ashley is at NEArc

Ashley, our Operations Coordinator, is speaking today at Spring Nearc. Thanks to the organizers for giving us a spot to share the news about our event. This year is the first year that I will not be attending or giving a workshop at this day conference. I really like this event because it's a great place to learn and spend some time with the local geospatial folks.

-   Next week I go to Vancouver for FME UC

Can't wait... If you are there find me to say hi and I'll give you some FOSS4G stickers. ;)
