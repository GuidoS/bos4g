### Early bird is closed

It's been a crazy week for us as organizers. We sold 300+ admissions with in the last few days of early bird registrations. It is very exciting to see people are signing up for the conference, workshops, and B2B. Registrations are coming from all over the world and from many different industries.

### JSGeo is sold out

JSGeo is a co-located conference that focuses on javascript development and it has sold out. There are a few more tickets coming up, please check their website at [jsgeo.com](http://jsgeo.com). I want to thank the JSGeo team for their support for FOSS4G. I am super thrilled to have their event tied to ours this summer.

### Ashley's big week

Ashley had a piece publishd by **opensource.com** "[Bringing together the best minds in open source geospatial technology](https://opensource.com/article/17/5/foss4g-boston)". It's so great to have our event and community highlighted across the open source community, not just within our own silo. I really hope that we can bring more people into our community and vice-versa from the broader OSS community.

Ashley also got a chance this week to speak at [Spring Nearc](http://www.northeastarc.org/spring-nearc.html) about FOSS4G. We are really appreciative to the organizers of spring NEArc for giving us a spot to share the news about our event.

### FME UC

**DISCLAIMER** My company is a partner with [Safe Software](https://www.safe.com/) and I am a FME Certified Professional.

I am headed out next week to Vancouver to participate in the [FMEUC conference](https://fmeuc.com/). I attended the last one a couple years ago and really enjoyed the time I spent with the [Safe Software](https://www.safe.com/) staff. Everyone, including the owners, are interested in what their customers need to get the job done.
